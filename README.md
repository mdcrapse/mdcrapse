ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Micheal

I have been designing and developing software since 2015.

### Projects
[Redux](redux.portneuf.cose.isu.edu/aboutus)
* Interactive library of Nondeterministic Polynomial-time Complete (NP-complete) problems.

* Created in collaboration with Idaho State University faculty and students.

[Musical Bindings](https://github.com/mdcrapse/musical_bindings)
* Binds musical notes from the microphone to simulated keyboard inputs.
* Utilizes Rust for performance and multithreading.
* Executes Lua scripts and analyzes the microphone audio buffer with ring buffers and message passing.

[Falcon Companion](https://github.com/mdcrapse/falcon_companion)
* A Chrome extension that allows the user to navigate a webpage with a game character.
* Utilizes Javascript and GdScript through the Chrome Extension API and the Godot 3 HTML export.
* Correctly interprets the DOM of most common web pages such as Wikipedia.

[Doodle Noodle](https://github.com/mdcrapse/doodle_noodle) (prototype)
* Transforms images of text into colliding objects on an Android phone.
* Utilizes Godot and Gdscript while leveraging a Rust dynamic link library for pixel search performance.

[Volcano Star](https://github.com/mdcrapse/volcano_star)
* Simulated sandbox.
* Makes use of object-oriented design philosophies for entities.

[Airline Seating](https://github.com/mdcrapse/airline_seating)
