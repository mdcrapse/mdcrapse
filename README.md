- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Micheal
- I'm interested in anything that involves software engineering.
You can have a look at some of the software I make by going over to [my itch page](https://mikeeybikeey.itch.io/). I'm always looking for mind-blowing ideas.
- I've used the following tools in the past: Game Maker Studio, Love2D, Godot, SFML, Raylib, tic80, C++, Rust, Lua, Python, Javascript, GDScript, and Game Maker Language.
- You can reach me by email: MikeeyBikeey@gmail.com
